## Description

If you have been purchasing video games over the years and want to keep track of your collection virtually, Backlog is the app to use!

Backlog is a fully functioning CRUD application that allows users to view their games, add new games to their collection, edit games, as well as delete games.

Users can register for Backlog with their Google Account to store their data (coming soon!)

## Features

* Users can created, read, update, and delete games from their virtual collections
* Users can authenticate through Google using 0auth2

* Users can rearrange their collection and organize by the data they want to see (coming soon!)

This is the original idea for the site's layout. This look was kept in mind and altered as development made progress.
